I want to do something different and meaningful before my college life ends.

Thus I decide to write some thoughts or goals here.

There are some common things that I always want to do but for all kinds of reasons I didn't or I failed.

### English
- speak fluent english 
- read 
- write
- listen

### Coding
- complete a small project

### Math
- do enough exercises

### Physical
- eat healthy
- exercise regularly
